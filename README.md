Little scripts that use the RustyController API to create amazing effects

## Rustea

Has a list of colors, each corresponding to a tea, and chooses a random one, allowing me to decide which one to take in the morning :9.

## Weathery

Queries [IPMA](https://www.ipma.pt/opencms/pt/index.html) for the next day's weather, and sets the color accordingly.
